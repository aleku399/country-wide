              In September 2015, while Uganda held the UN presidency, the 192
              Member States of the United Nations (UN) again adopted a historic
              resolution committing themselves to the 2030 Agenda for
              Sustainable Development. Agenda 2030 and its associated SDGs
              informs and guides global and national development.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17
              ambitious, transformative and universal Goals with a total of 169
              targets and 232 indicators that will guide national and local
              development by 2030. They aim at eradicating poverty through a
              focus on partnerships, people, planet, prosperity, and peace.
            </p>
            <p>
              SDGs are different from all other international development
              frameworks considering that they are more ambitious, universal,
              holistic and inclusive as follows:
